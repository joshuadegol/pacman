# pacman
# description
This is a project written in JavaScript that allows you to spawn and move pacmen around your browser window. It is a great project for people that want to learn JavaScript code.
# how to use
1. Download all of the files from this repository into your repository. Make sure they are all located in the same place. Make sure to include the images as well. 
2. Open in a web browser.
3. click the "start game" to start moving the pacmen. 
4. click the "add pacman" to add more.
# future improvments
I would like to add buttons to change the shape and the size of the individual pacmen.
